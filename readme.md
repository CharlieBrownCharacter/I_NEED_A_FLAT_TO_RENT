# Welcome to the script that will save your life!

Hey, have you ever had felt the pain of searching for that perfect flat in https://njuskalo.hr?
When you find it it is too late. Someone else was pressing F5 faster than you and all that precious time wasted (not the ring here)

# How to run this script

First you would need to have python installed of course. After that you will need to have `pip` installed.
1. pip  install  beautifulsoup4
2. pip install requests

After that you can just hit in the console: `python2.7 main.py &` 


## File constants.py	

The file `constants.py` holds all the constants necessary for the script to run:
1. PAGE: the page you would like to scrap. Make sure the page is ordering the results by `newest`
2. FILE_LOCATION: the location of the file that will be used to store the latest item scanned
3. FILE_NAME: the name of the file mentioned above
4. SECONDS_TO_CALL_FUNCTION: how many seconds interval you would like to run the script (less seconds makes you have more concrete results - therefore being able to see ad first - but make sure not to bombard `njuskalo` website).


## Disclaimer
I do not support the usage of this script to illegal activities. This script was made purely for academical purposes.
